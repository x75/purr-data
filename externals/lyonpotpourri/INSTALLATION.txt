This distribution comes with binaries for both OSX (10.9) and Linux (Ubuntu 64-bit). To install, move folders “lyonpotpourri-externals” and “lyonpotpourri-helpfiles” to a location within your Pd search path. If the shipped externals work with your computer hardware, you are good to go. Otherwise, you will need to recompile the externals by typing “make” in a Terminal window. If on OSX, you need to have the developer tools installed in order to run Make.
